Python program plan.

[X] Could use more complicated code to decide where timelag is placed: something triggy?
[X] Color gradient - See Stackexchange post
[X] Link with main github.
[ ] Add color legend
    [ ] Only used colors? Would need to store separately.
[ ] Can the arrows be specified curved in someway? (With gradient you could do this I think.
[X] Make easier to run on other data using command line args
[X] Node colors
[ ] How to display node names/numbers? Perhaps need numbers + a key.

[/] Straight arrows? Maybe transform first and then interpolate. (Should work... hmm.)
    This is straight_line set to true or false when plotting the gradient line. (Will need to adjust the arrows too though...)
