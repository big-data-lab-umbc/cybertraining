          Added warning about ocean surface reflection model to shdom.txt.

15NOV09   Added memory parameter input file for multiple processors
             on shared memory computers.

             output formats to netcdf files (thanks to Robert Pincus).

 3MAR08   Fixed open boundary condition bug in DIRECT_BEAM_PROP.
            (Thanks to Richard Siddans)

 6JUNE05  Limited SHDOM acceleration parameter to be less than 10; having
             no limit might have caused divergence for optically thick IPA.
           Fixed make_ice_table.f90 database reading allocation bug.
           Fixed lowest level indexing error in ckdlwrrtm.f (27-JAN-2004).

10JULY03  Corrected problem with ice scattering database (sw_ice_scatter.db)
             by rescaling extinction efficiency, single scattering albedo, 
             and asymmetry parameter for "delta transmission" of rays
             through parallel ice crystal faces.

20JUNE03  Major upgrade release.
           Added new optical property file generation system consisting
             of make_mie_table.f90 and make_ice_table.f90 for creating
             single scattering table files for spherical particles
             and 8 shapes of ice crystals (shortwave only), and 
             propgen.f90 for producing property files with arbitrary
             mixtures of particles at each grid point.
           Added modified version of 6S ocean surface reflectance BRDF 
             model to SHDOM (wavelength is now a required input parameter).
           Modified RPV BRDF surface reflection function according to
             Alexei Lyapustin for added robustness.
           Added camera and cross-track scanning image "visualization"
             output to SHDOM and example scripts and IDL programs.
           Added longwave and shortwave RRTM based k-distribution programs.

27JULY99  Modified cloudprp to change aerosol input file format (added 
           distribution width and index of refraction dependence on wavelength)

 1JUNE99  Major upgrade release.
           Added Fortran 90 main program (shdom90) with allocatable arrays.
           New version of cloudprp.f.  Different modes for Mie table
             generation. Faster Mie table generation.  Added aerosol
             properties input from file.  Added lognormal size distributions
             (courtesy of Lin Chambers).  Fixed bug for effective radius
             off end of table.   (2/99)
           Included program to plot phase functions in Mie tables.
           Included documentation file for cloudprp and ckdfu.
           Included more example scripts in distribution.
           Included IDL SHDOM file input and visualization procedures.

           Fixed horizontal range of radiance output in open boundary conditions
             Note: this changed the input parameters for radiance output.
           Added input parameter checking subroutine.
           Fixed bugs for large optical depth per grid cell in    (5/98)
             k-distributions by initializing for each k (INRADFLAG=.FALSE.).
           Fixed bug for isotropic source function with NPHI>32.  (1/99)
           Added checks for negative absorption in CKD file, and
             negative phase function from severe Legendre truncation.


20JUN97   Added general surface bidirectional reflectance functions.
           Added open horizontal boundary conditions (new input - BCFLAG).
           Improved adaptive grid cell splitting method (affects SPLITACC).
           Improved response when adaptive grid generation runs out of memory.
           Added code option for outputting rms of higher order radiance.
           Added double gaussian discrete ordinate set option.

20DEC96   Put in MAXRADOUT constant for radiance output array size.
             Fixed heating rate bug for thermal emission with SH truncation

 2AUG96   Modified ckdfu.f to output CKD info at atmosphere file levels.

30JUL96   Fixed bug that happened when NPHI was not a good FFT size (44,56,).
           Fixed negative source bug: "Grid point has no contribution".

11JUL96   Put in reading Z base grid from zgrid.inp file (GRIDTYPE='F').
           Allowed delta-M mode for thermal source.
           Referred to online journal article in documentation.

16MAY96   Put in transmission cutoff to speed up optically thick radiances
           Added J (source function) output

 7MAY96   Fixed cell integration formula for large cell optical path
           Fixed initialization of l=0 m=0 radiance term
           cloudprp.f: fixed number of size integration steps

           Echo parameter values in input routine. 
           Solar direct beam in mean radiance, net flux output
